# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
  
This mini-project is built using Vite and Tailwind CSS to create a password input with a visibility toggle. It also includes a real-time password strength indicator. Based on the length, it displays 'Weak' (0-4), 'Medium' (5-8), or 'Strong' (9+).
